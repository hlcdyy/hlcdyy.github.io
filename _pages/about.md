I am currently a Ph.D. student at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Shihong Xia. My work lies in the intersection between computer graphics and deep learning, with a focus on human motion modeling including motion synthesis, processing, and pose estimation. Prior to that, I received a B.Sc. in mathematics and applied mathematics from Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU), China, in 2019.
